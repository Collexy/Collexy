This project is still in its very early development phase <i>(Phase 1)</i>.

Phases:

1. Proof of concept only: Quick and dirty prototype-ish code. <strong>(where we're currently at)</strong>
2. Database architecture analysis: Make sure the foundation is solid before rewriting the code completely.
3. Total code rewrite: Adhere to design patterns, Go/angular/postgres best practices and modularize, promote extensibility and have a plugin architecture in mind.
4. Extensibility: Make the necessary changes for seemless plugin integration and improve extensibility 
5. Public alpha release
6. Optimize, refactor, optimize, REFACTOR...
7. Beta
8. Optimize some more
9. First official release (v. 1.0.0)
